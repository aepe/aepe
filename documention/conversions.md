### Seeding 
plants per m2 -> acre 
Multiply plants per m2 by 4046 to get acre seeding density. e.g. 8 * 4046 = 32k plants per acre.

acre -> m2
Or, since there are 2.47105 acres in a hectare, to get seeding rate of 165,000 per acre to hectare  
take 165000*2.47105 = 407723.25 then divide my 10000 to get in sq-meters for final seeding of 40.77 or 41.

### Fertiliser
kg/ha -> lbs/ac  
1kg/ha = 0.892179 lbs/acre  
or divide kg/ha by 1.121  
eg 120kg/ha / 1.121 = 107 lbs/acre

lb/ac -> kg/ha
lb/acre * 1.121
eg 107 lb/ac * 1.121 = 120kg/ha

### Depths  
Multiply depth in in. by 25.4 to get depth in mm.
